					locatefile_extended() has an important difference from 
					locatefile() and locatefiletype() that may require some rewriting

					locatefile() and locatefiletype() do not. The two cases where it 
					could modify the incoming filename string are 1) when an alias is 
					specified, the file pointed to by the alias is returned; and 2) when a full 
					path is specified, the output is the filename plus the path number of the 
					folder it's in. 
					
					This is important because many people pass the s_name field of a 
					#t_symbol to locatefile(). If the name field of a #t_symbol were to be 
					modified, the symbol table would be corrupted. To avoid this problem, 
					use strncpy_zero() to copy the contents of a #t_symbol to a character string first, 
					as shown below:
